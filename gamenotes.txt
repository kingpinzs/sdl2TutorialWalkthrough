if something is declared new then there should be a matching delete
callbacks????
differnce between struct and class is public or private members and base class

keep differnt logic seprated from each other
for example game loop aka even loop should not be intertwind with the render aka gfx
game class
gfx class
what we need 
SDl 2.0.5
------------

event loop aka (game loop) goals:
- handle input dont show cursor sdl_showcursore 
- update and render 
- fps limit (60 frames per second)
- hot reload
 
solution:
game class
- init file
-- init sdl
-- eventloop()
--- while(running) -- this loop last 1/60th second or 1000/60th of ms
     delay loop for 1000/60th of a scond so speed cap
---- take time from here to so the above minuse the time that has elapsed aka current time - start time
---- handle input,  sdl pole events - sdl_events escape to exit
---- update() - move things, check collitions
---- draw() - aka render to the screen
---- the time it takes to get here
-- deconstruct 
--- SDL_Quit


testing the event loop
- if the event loop is running at 60 fps
